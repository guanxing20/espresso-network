TODO: provide prebuilt binaries

To build and run the staking-cli

    cargo run --bin staking-cli -p staking-cli -- --help

For brevity what follows assumes the `staking-cli` binary is in the `PATH`.

To show help for a command run `staking-cli COMMAND --help`, for example `staking-cli delegate --help`.

If you run into any problems please open an issue on https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network.

## Getting Started

### Overview

You can get help for the CLI by running:

    staking-cli --help

Which will show all the available commands and options shared by commands:

            L1 Ethereum RPC

            [env: L1_PROVIDER=]

        --token-address <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
            Deployed ESP token contract address

            [env: ESP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=]

        --stake-table-address <STAKE_TABLE_ADDRESS>
            Deployed stake table contract address

            [env: STAKE_TABLE_ADDRESS=]

        --mnemonic <MNEMONIC>
            The mnemonic to use when deriving the key

            [env: MNEMONIC=]

        --account-index <ACCOUNT_INDEX>
            The mnemonic account index to use when deriving the key

            [env: ACCOUNT_INDEX=]

        --ledger
            Use a ledger device to sign transactions.

            NOTE: ledger must be unlocked, Ethereum app open and blind signing must be enabled in the Ethereum app settings.

            [env: USE_LEDGER=]

```

or by passing `--help` to a command, for example `delegate`:

        staking-cli delegate --help

which will show the options specific to the command:

```
Delegate funds to a validator

Usage: staking-cli delegate --validator-address <VALIDATOR_ADDRESS> --amount <AMOUNT>

Options:
    --validator-address <VALIDATOR_ADDRESS>
    --amount <AMOUNT>
-h, --help                                   Print help
```

### Choose your type of wallet (mnemonic based or Ledger)

First, determine if you would like to use a Mnemonic phrase or ledger hardware wallet.

If you don't know which account index to use, you can find it by running:

```bash
staking-cli --mnemonic MNEMONIC --account-index 0 account
staking-cli --mnemonic MNEMONIC --account-index 1 account
# etc, or
staking-cli --ledger-index 0 account
staking-cli --ledger-index 1 account
# etc
```

Repeat with different indices until you find the address you want to use.

Note that for ledger signing to work

1. the ledger needs to be unlocked,
1. the Ethereum app needs to be open,
1. blind signing needs to be enabled in the Ethereum app settings on the ledger.

To avoid passing the mnemonic on the command line, the MNEMONIC env var can be set instead.

### Initialize the configuration file

Once you've identified your desired account index (here 2), initialize a configuration file:

    staking-cli init --mnemonic MNEMONIC --account-index 2
    # or
    staking-cli init --ledger-index 2

This creates a TOML config file with the contracts of our decaf Testnet, deployed on Sepolia. With the config file you
don't need to provide the configuration values every time you run the CLI.

NOTE: only for this `init` command the `--mnemonic` and `--ledger-index` flags are specified _after_ the command.

### Inspect the configuration

You can inspect the configuration file by running:

         staking-cli config

### View the stake table

You can use the following command to display the current L1 stake table:

    staking-cli stake-table

## Delegators (or stakers)

This section covers commands for stakers/delegators.

### Delegating

1.  Obtain ESP tokens for staking.
1.  Find the Ethereum address of a validator to delegate to.

        staking-cli stake-table

1.  Use the `approve` command to allow the stake table to spend your tokens.

        staking-cli approve --amount 123

1.  Use the `delegate` command to delegate your tokens to a validator.

        staking-cli delegate --validator-address 0x12...34 --amount 123

### Undelegating

1.  If you would like to undelegate your tokens, use the `undelegate` command.

        staking-cli undelegate --validator-address 0x12...34 --amount 123

1.  Wait for the exit escrow period to end (currently 1 week), then withdraw to your wallet.

        staking-cli claim-withdrawal --validator-address 0x12...34

### Recovering funds after a validator exit

1.  Wait for the exit escrow period to elapse after the validator deregistered itself (currently 1 week), then withdraw
    to your wallet by running

         staking-cli claim-validator-exit --validator-address 0x12...34

## Node operators

This section covers commands for node operators.

### Registering a validator

1.  Obtain your validator's BLS and state private keys and choose your commission in percent, with 2 decimals.
1.  Use the `register-validator` command to register your validator.

        staking-cli register-validator --consensus-private-key <BLS_KEY> --state-private-key <STATE_KEY> --commission 4.99

    To avoid specifying the the keys on the command line they can be set via env vars

    ```
    CONSENSUS_PRIVATE_KEY=BLS_SIGNING_KEY~...
    STATE_PRIVATE_KEY=SCHNORR_SIGNING_KEY~...
    ```

- Each Ethereum account used must have enough gas funds on the L1 to call the registration method of the contract. The
  register transaction consumes about 300k gas.
- Each BLS (Espresso) and key can be registered only once.
- The commission cannot be changed later. One would need to deregister the validator, register it again, and direct
  delegators to redelegate in order to change it.
- Each Ethereum account can only be used to register a single validator. For multiple validators, at a minimum,
  different account indices (or mnemonics) must be used.

### De-registering your validator

WARNING: running this command will remove your validator from the stake table and undelegate all the funds delegated to
it.

    staking-cli deregister-validator

### Rotating your consensus keys

1.  Obtain your validator's new BLS and state private keys.
1.  Run

        staking-cli update-consensus-keys --consensus-private-key BLS_KEY --state-private-key STATE_KEY

    The new keys will become active in the 3rd epoch after the command is run.

    To avoid specifying the the keys on the command line they can be set via env vars

    ```
    CONSENSUS_PRIVATE_KEY=BLS_SIGNING_KEY~...
    STATE_PRIVATE_KEY=SCHNORR_SIGNING_KEY~...
    ```
